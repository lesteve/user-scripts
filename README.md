A few useful userscripts for github. They were originally created in a
scikit-learn context but are likely to be useful outside it.

* expand outdated comments in github, which makes it easy to search through old
  comments after the code has been modified
* adds a CircleCI button to easily access HTML generated CircleCI doc

To use these userscripts you will need to have a userscript manager installed
in your browser such as [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) or
[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).
